- Working in an initiative to build frugal X-ray detectors with camera-based sensors. 
- Developing **a model to revert image processing algorithms** to recover X-ray transmission maps from chest x-ray datasets.
  The motivation is to simulate a dataset of X-ray images captured by camera-based detectors.
