- Worked along with the Host supply team to build an internal tool to visualize relevant metrics and summaries related to the hosts used at Uber (e. g. software and hardware information, categories, and issues).
- Implemented multiple visualization features with **React, Highcharts, Presto** as the query engine, and built a **client-side cache** to reduce long fetching times.
