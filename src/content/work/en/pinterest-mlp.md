- Worked with ML Data Platform, contributing to an internal offline dataset storage service.
- Broadened the user base for a **Spark-based feature storage**. Built an alternate in-memory API to load and commit data for pandas DataFrames, removing the overhead tied to using Spark (for appropriate cases, e.g. low volume datasets).
- Improved dependency tracking for stored feature datasets by designing and implementing a component to infer dependencies from Spark RDDs metadata stored within the team's internal service.
