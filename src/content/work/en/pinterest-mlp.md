- Worked with ML Data Platform, contributing to an internal offline dataset storage service.
- Broadened the user base for a Big Data feature storage service by enabling use cases with low volumes of data. Provided an alternate (non-Spark) interface to load and commit data for pandas DataFrames.
- Designed and built a system to improve the service's dependency tracking for stored datasets by leveraging Spark RDDs metadata to infer dependencies.
